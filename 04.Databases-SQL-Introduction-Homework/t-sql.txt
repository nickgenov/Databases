Problem 2.	What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?

Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to SQL. T-SQL expands on the SQL 
standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string 
processing, date processing, loops, exceptions, if statements, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE 
and UPDATE statements. 
These additional features make Transact-SQL Turing complete. It is used in Microsoft's SQL Server.

T-SQL is designed for writing logic inside the database:
Database stored procedures
Database functions
Database triggers
