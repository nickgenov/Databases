Problem 10.	SQL Language
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control.

SELECT 
	R.RiverName AS [River], 
	COUNT(C.CountryName) AS [Countries Count]
FROM Rivers R
JOIN CountriesRivers CR
ON CR.RiverId = R.Id
JOIN Countries C
ON C.CountryCode = CR.CountryCode
GROUP BY R.RiverName
HAVING COUNT(C.CountryName) >= 3
ORDER BY R.RiverName ASC
